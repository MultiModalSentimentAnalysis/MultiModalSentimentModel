Give a short, self-contained summary of necessary background
information. 

For our example if your project is a new \paxos implementation, the background
would be a brief introduction to the consensus problem, the \paxos algorithm,
the system model used by the \paxos algorithm
and common optimizations and relevant variations of that algorithm.

The goal of the background section is to make the paper 
self-contained for an audience as large as possible. As in every
section you start with a very brief overview of the section.
For our example that would be: In this section, we introduce the consensus problem,
the \paxos algorithm and common optimizations of that algorithm.

If you copy a definition from a text book or some other source, you must cite that source. 
See Example~\ref{def:consensus} below.
