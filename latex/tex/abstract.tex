%The abstract describes in concise words what you do, why you do it (not
%necessarily in this order), and the main result. The abstract
%has to be self-contained and readable for a person in the
%general area. We suggest to write the abstract first,
%as a means to guide the work, but it should be updated continuously.

Emotions could be recognized in a video by analyzing its script, frames, audio, or a combination of those called "multi-modal methods." In this project, we propose several algorithms for a combination of processing the script as a Natural Language Processing task and scenes of a video by studying people's face and pose in order to recognize their emotions. Our analysis reveals that this combination in video analysis can result better in emotional recognition rather than using only one of its aspects.
