%The abstract describes in concise words what you do, why you do it (not
%necessarily in this order), and the main result. The abstract
%has to be self-contained and readable for a person in the
%general area. We suggest to write the abstract first,
%as a means to guide the work, but it should be updated continuously.

Emotions could be recognized in a video by analyzing its text, frames, audio, or a combination of those called "multi-modal methods." In this project, we will propose a few algorithms to combine different features of a video in order to recognize the overall emotion of the scene. Our analysis reveals that this combination in video analysis can result in better emotion recognition models rather than using only one of its aspects.
